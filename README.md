# Introduction on NHANES
This is our study on the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Exam Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control.
Through this project, we aim to use this as a proof of concept (POC) for a proposal to emulate this dashboard in the Philippine context.

**Intended Users:** General Public
**Purpose of the Dashboard:** Given that the Philippines is a very conservative country, people are not comfortable in talking about sex or anything related to it. This lack of communication and education in turn creates a lack of awareness on the issue. Therefore, we aim to increase awareness on and to de-stigmatize Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) by creating two things:
- a dashboard (Dashboard_Sample) - can be embedded on a website.
- an infogrpahic (Infographic_Sample) - can be shared online or even printed and physically shared to others.


## Summary of the experience
We have divided the process of the project into 4 parts: Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, Key-Value Mapping, Dashboard and Infographic Design

We web scraped the legends in the NHANES website to get a good grasp of our data. From there, we cleaned and mapped the values.
We even tried to use PCA and Random Forest to try to reduce the number of features, but in the end, due to the lack of time, we chose to use featrues deemed to be relevant based what's stated on research papers online.
